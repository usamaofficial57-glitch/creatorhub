# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

FRONTEND ISSUE: Dashboard incorrectly displays 'Welcome to CreatorHub' no-channels state despite having connected channels. ROOT CAUSE: 1) Frontend fetchDashboardData() function not properly loading connected channels on initial render, 2) Analytics API returns connected:false even when channels exist, 3) Dashboard state management logic failing to detect and display connected channels. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS: Dashboard shows 'Connect Your First Channel' button instead of channel analytics, no 'Your Channels' section visible, no channel count badges, no 'Manage Channels' button in header. MODAL ACCESSIBILITY: Channel management modal not opening properly due to state mismatch. This confirms the user's reported issue: 'dashboard shows nothing when channels are connected'.

CURRENT ALGORITHM VERIFIED ✅: Formula max(1, int((estimated_monthly_views / 1000) * final_rpm)) is working correctly. REVENUE CALCULATION COMPONENTS ANALYZED: 1) Base RPM rates by category (Finance: $8.50, Tech: $6.20, Gaming: $2.20, Entertainment: $1.80), 2) Geography multiplier based on channel size and category (1.2x for tech/finance, 0.9x for gaming/entertainment), 3) Channel size multiplier (10M+ subscribers: 1.4x, 1M+: 1.2x, 100K+: 1.1x), 4) Monthly view estimation based on total views, video count, and channel size. CONNECTED CHANNEL ANALYSIS ✅: Marques Brownlee (20.2M subscribers, 4.9B total views, 1,757 videos) → Estimated $850,548 monthly revenue using tech category RPM. DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ASSESSMENT: CURRENTLY CONSIDERED (5 factors): Channel category/niche, channel size, estimated geography, content volume, channel maturity. MISSING FACTORS (11 advanced demographics): Audience age demographics, detailed geographic distribution, audience income level, engagement quality, watch time vs views, subscriber engagement rate, seasonal patterns, device usage, viewing time patterns. ANSWER TO USER QUESTION: The current system does NOT consider 'niche audience age and so on' - it uses simplified category-based estimation instead of detailed audience demographic analysis. Revenue varies significantly by channel type (Gaming: $250/month for 50K subs vs Finance: $110K/month for 2M subs) but lacks sophisticated audience demographic targeting that would provide more accurate revenue predictions."

SOPHISTICATED DEMOGRAPHIC SYSTEM CONFIRMED ✅: System implements comprehensive 3-factor demographic analysis with age-based multipliers (13-17: 0.6x to 35-44: 1.5x), gender-based multipliers (female: 1.15x premium), geographic tier system (4 tiers from 1.0x to 0.15x), weighted combination (Geography 50%, Age 35%, Gender 15%), and 7-day MongoDB caching. FINAL ANSWER TO REVIEW QUESTION: The system IS using exact demographic factors (age, gender, geography) with sophisticated weighted calculations, NOT basic estimation. The revenue calculation properly uses demographic multipliers instead of simple category-based estimation, implementing industry-standard RPM rates with realistic audience demographic analysis for accurate revenue predictions."
